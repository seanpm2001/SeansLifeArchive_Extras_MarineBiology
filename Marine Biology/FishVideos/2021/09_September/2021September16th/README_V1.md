## About

I created a much shorter video today; Todays video was 40 seconds of calming 4K fishtank footage. <!-- Todays video was a bit blurry, as I didn't turn off another light before recording, as I didn't think it would affect it. Todays video was done in the blue light again, it has gotten pretty dark again recently, returning to a dark blue color. We normally have the blue light on, as it doesn't bug the other residents in the house this way. It was enabled. !--> Todays video was in the white light. <!-- Todays video was done in the normal white light for once in some time. !--> Today, I got the usual stock footage. <!-- The suckerfish has been incredibly actively lately, almost like it knows it is being filmed and is photogenic. I plan on doing all the videos in the whitelight from now on, unless I want to do a dark light video on a special occasion, or if I forget, as I can turn the light on any time now. !-->

## Daily updates

### 2021 status updates

**Entries for June 2021 need to be dated at some point.**

#### June 2021 status updates

There was a new concern x days ago regarding the cleaner fish, it was unknown what was growing on its face (I noticed a symmetrical pattern of a 3x3 grid of pink scabs, along with a ton of white scabs on the fish's head) it was researched, it is likely not a [Lymphocystivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocystivirus) but more likely an aspect of catfish aging, which is reasonable, as the markings were symmetrical, and this fish is at least 8 years old.

I have been observing a fish recently, I have finally identified it this evening (Tuesday, June 22nd 2021) which is that one of the bright orange goldfish has a possible bacterial infection in the operculum (gill cover, or the part that is between the head and the rest of the body) before this, I have noted for a few weeks that its eye has been pretty bad. I have now determined that the fish really isn't doing too well, and I feel bad for it (a little bit sad as well) I am looking for a solution, I have researched (but please, don't try this yourself until you do proper research as well, as I know you don't want to harm your fish) but adding 3% salinity to the water of the diseased fish (but probably not the entire fishtank) has been noted to cure most freshwater fish bacterial infections. Again, please do not take my word for this, do your own research first and back it up, as I haven't tried this yet, and I don't know if [TheSprucePets.com]https://www.thespruecepets.com) is a safe source.

I haven't tried anything with the fish yet, it isn't getting worse, but I currently am not sure what to do.

The fish isn't getting worse, the problem has reached a stalemate.

I have failed to mention this for a long time, but I have not been able to publish any of my marine biology videos due to their excessive size (I haven't had a single video under 100 megabytes yet, and they range from 160 to 750 megabytes in size) so most of the things I am talking about can't be backed up, as you can't even see the video, so you likely don't know what I am talking about. I have been working on getting these videos to be made public (YouTube isn't an option) I have considered Vimeo, but it would cost too much to host, and I have been working on getting the videos self-hosted, but it has been a long process.

<!-- Unfortunately, in the other fishtank today, a fish died. The cause of death is unknown and an autopsy was not done. !-->

I have been observing one of the black speckled fish and have noted that it struggles to rise over an inch above the gravel before falling back down. The fish is still eating, and looks healthy other than that, I can only watch. It is eating a lot better now, but is hard to find around the tank when needed.

I have now noted that the fish has swam up for oxygen multiple times, and is doing a lot better.

The fish is no longer of concern. - June 30th 2021

#### July 2021 status updates

The fish is doing fine still and has not worsened. - July 3rd 2021

All the fish are still doing fine, the silver goldfish are growing the fastest. - July 4th 2021

Status update: the fish are still doing fine. - July 5th 2021

Status update: the fish may be doing fine, I don't know if there was 2 of the same type (of concern) to begin with, there has been only 1 for a few days. - July 6th 2021

Update: the suckerfish is extremely fast and may be a threat to other fish due to increased aggression. So far, no known deaths. - July 7th 2021

The suckerfish was extremely active tonight, and was spazzing around at the bottom of the tank for a bit. - July 8th 2021

I am under suspicion that one of the fish was killed and somehow me and some others forgot that it existed. The remains seem to be completely destroyed, so unfortunately if it did exist, no funeral can be held. - July 9th 2021

The suckerfish may be photogenic. - July 10th 2021

The light emulates day and night for the fish. I wonder what their days are like when it is so inconsistent. - July 11th 2021

First 8K video today, 4K videos return tomorrow. - July 12th 2021

Returned to 4K videos today, but with a higher aspect ratio. - July 13th 2021

Purple lighting today. - July 14th 2021

I forgot my rule and filmed in the blue light today, I guess I just didn't care enough. They need a nighttime anyways. - July 15th 2021

Blue light again today, and a very long video. Some interaction was done. - July 16th 2021

I have recently gotten burnt out mentally on getting these videos, and want to improve the tank to feel better about getting more footage, or doing something to make the videos a lot better. - July 17th 2021

My burnout has gone away slightly, I need to focus on ways of making better videos sometime soon. The fish are doing fine today. - July 18th 2021

BONUS: This README file was heavily improved today and is now better sorted and categorized. It contains better info, and is now part of a routine of 3 updates every 3 days. - July 18th 2021

I got a longer video today to make up for the lack of activity. Todays video length makes up for the movement. I wasn't burnt out today. The fish were again doing fine today. - July 19th 2021

I don't know what happened, but todays video was a bit foggy/dusty, I do not know what happened to cause it to do this, but I will attempt to fix this by tomorrow. - July 20th 2021

I wasn't able to fix the dust issue, but it was fine. The fish are also doing fine. - July 21st 2021

I fixed the dust issue, and got my longest video to date, being 120 seconds (or 2 minutes) long and taking up over a gigabyte in size. The fish were calm during the video, and I made it longer, so that it could calm future viewers. - July 22nd 2021

Back to a shorter video again today, todays video was 45 seconds long, and the fish were calm again. - July 23rd 2021

Same video length and format today, different activity. - July 24th 2021

Same video length and format today, different activity. The fish are doing fine still, I don't know what to contribute for a daily entry. - July 25th 2021

I got a shorter video today, and did the usual recording. Documentation wise, I didn't meet my `update-every-3-days` goal, and I found that my entry for July 23rd 2021 contained the wrong size data, so I will list it again here:

I hope to get to documenting it again soon. - July 26th 2021

I failed to document today, and I got a shorter video today. - July 27th 2021

I failed to document again today, and I got a slightly shorter video today. I have not been able to make interesting descriptions for a while. - July 28th 2021 

I was able to document the marine biology project today, and I got a normal fishtank video tonight. I am preparing to transition my role of recording to 2 other family members while I am away in Redmond. - July 29th 2021

Todays video was recorded by Mitchell Myrick while I was on vacation. I was worried that he might forget, but he got it for the 2 days I was on vacation. Todays video was highly interactive, and was not made by me. - July 30th 2021

Todays video was again recorded by Mitchell Myrick while I was on vacation. Todays video was highly interactive again, and was not made by me. - July 31st 2021

#### August 2021 status updates

I got back from my vacation today and continued my daily videos. - August 1st 2021

I produced a slightly longer video today, I am not making highly interactive videos, as they are not my style. This isn't saying that my videos aren't interactive. - August 2nd 2021

I produced a shorter video today. The fishtank is going to need to be refilled soon, as it is a few inches short. - August 3rd 2021

The suckerfish acted pretty quirky in todays video and made for an interesting video today. Also, the tank got refilled earlier today. - August 4th 2021

I recorded a normal video today, although a bit longer. The fish really beg for food, but I feed them multiple times (2 to 3 times) per day, so just ignore them this time. - August 5th 2021

I recorded a video in half the time today. It is sometimes difficult to tell from the footage if I am referring to blue light or white light, I have been making sure to turn the light on lately, although todays video looks like it was done in a darker light. It wasn't. - August 6th 2021

I recorded a slightly longer video today. I am not going to bother with the lighting this time, so blue light it is (I really can't tell, it is really dark, so I assume it is blue light) the fish did fine today, they again begged for food, despite being fed twice today. &turns around to fish& %stop it, you are going to get me in trouble% - August 7th 2021

I made a longer video today. The lighting went back to normal. There really isn't too much to talk about, not much has changed. - August 8th 2021

I made a 1 minute video again today, the suckerfish got really freaked out in the beginning, and moved around the bottom of the tank very rapidly. I don't know why it is so shy/cowardly. - August 9th 2021

I made 2 videos today, as originally, I was trying to figure out why my camera was odd. The resolution was adjusted and I had to make a second video today. Todays videos were pretty normal. - August 10th 2021

I made a single, 80 second video today. Todays video was pretty tame again. - August 11th 2021.

I made a shorter video today that was pretty tame and normal again. - August 12th 2021

I made a double video today, but quickly corrected the problem, but didn't delete the resulting 1 second video due to my no-delete policy. Again, todays video was tame today. - August 13th 2021

I made a unique video today, but background noise messed it up. I had the unique pan and zoom up intro, and had robotic motions at various points. This might have been the actual cause of ruining the video. - August 14th 2021

I went back to a more normal, but more interesting video today. - August 15th 2021

I recorded a short video today, and fed the fish after recording. I am considering naming all the fish in the tank. - August 16th 2021

I recorded a tame, normal video today and gave the fish more food than I ever have in 1 go the next morning (effectively feeding them for the day) as an experiment to see how much they can eat, and how well I can distribute the food. - August 17th 2021

I filmed a normal video today and fed the fish heavily after recording. I don't like that as the fish grow, their scales don't grow with them, I hope this is fixed soon. - August 18th 2021

I filmed a longer video today and fed the fish heavily after recording. I am still working on naming the fish. - August 19th 2021

I filmed a long video again today and fed the fish heavily after recording. I have temporarily stopped working on naming the fish. - August 20th 2021

I filmed a short video today and fed the fish heavily after recording. I have temporarily stopped working on naming the fish. - August 21st 2021

I made a short video today, I have been focused on making shorter videos to save space lately. We have ran out of fish food today, last night after recording, I used up the rest of the fishfood, as there wasn't much left. Today, the bottle is in the video, but the supply is empty. More food has been ordered and it will arrive in a couple days. If not, we have additional backup food somewhere. The fish can go without feeding for a couple of days (I have heard stories of people not feeding their goldfish for weeks and they still end up fine, but I am not even going to make my fish wait half a week) - August 22nd 2021

The fish are still doing fine. I made a normal video today. Note that I don't have to create a good description every day, it isn't always possible. - August 23rd 2021

We received new fish food today of a different brand. I think fish have a sense of taste, I don't know if they can indicate which kind they like better. We got the kind of a different brand, and the can is really tall. The flakes are also a bit more rugged, maybe because it is newer. The fish did fine today. - August 24th 2021

I got a normal video today, I got Suckys aggression on camera this time. - August 25th 2021

I got a normal video again today. Not much of interest happened. - August 26th 2021

I got a normal video again today. Not much of interest again happened. - August 27th 2021

I got a normal video again today. Not much of interest happened again today. - August 28th 2021

I got 2 videos today due to an error at the end. I ended the video abruptly, as when I was going to zoom in on the suckerfish, it swapped the camera (which reminds me that I need to put tape back over my back camera) as such, 2 videos were made, one of them cuts about 2 seconds of my dehydrated face out (I didn't drink enough today, that is why my mouth may look weird) - August 29th 2021

I got a longer video today, although not much of interest happened. Sucky was acting normal today, and I was able to get a successful zoom-in today without error. I have now noted that one of the orange goldfish is getting close to the size of the biggest goldfish (Græy/Brown/Silver) - 2021 August 30th

> Side note: I have found it more convenient to write `Gray/Grey` as `Græy`, as it lets me use the cool Latin ligature ae, or `æ` and it counts as saying both versions of the word with 4 less characters (actually 0, as the Unicode codepoint takes up 4 bytes, but it is still fine) I am doing it like this, as I have no other preferred way of saying `Grey` or `Gray`.

I got a slightly longer video today, there was a lot of noise in the background, but luckily it died down. The videos aren't meant to be watched with sound anyways, but I try to be as quiet as possible. That is why I have everything around me paused while I record. Unfortunately, life happens, and there is the sound of a dog shaking off, a laundry machine, or something else. - 2021 August 31st

#### 2021 September status updates

No status posts for this month yet.

I recorded a normal video today, and also placed a new rock in the fishtank, it was knocked over in less than an hour, although it is something new for them. I was going to put a cool square rock into the tank, but I couldn't get this horrible diseased stain off of it, and there wasn't that much room in the fishtank. - 2021 September 1st

I recorded a normal video today, I am still trying to think of ways to change things up for the videos. Maybe I should rearrange the decorations, or maybe I should just let the fish live their life like this. I did do something different off camera today, which is that I gave the fish a live spider from the outside of the tank, although I not sure if it went in or not. - 2021 September 2nd

I made a normal video today, I was tired during recording and didn't focus well (this didn't affect the video) but the fish were as active as me at the moment. - 2021 September 3rd

I made a normal video today, although it was done in the blue light today. The fish were active today, but their activity was masked in the murky shade of blue light. - 2021 September 4th

Nothing interesting happened in todays video other than Sucky acting weirdly calm. - 2021 September 5th

The fish gradually went back and forth across the tank across the course of a minute, you know, the usual. - 2021 September 6th

The lighting was set to blue today, but it was really dimmed, so the footage was easier to see. The fish went about their usual everyday activites today. - 2021 September 7th

The same format of video was done today, nothing new, nothing to add. - 2021 September 8th

The fish were really hyper tonight. They calmed down halfway into the recording, but the early activity was interesting. - 2021 September 9th

I decided not to request for a sound free period for todays video, as there was an ongoing issue related to the crash and it didn't feel appropriate to ask anymore tonight. It doesn't affect the video too much, and the background audio didn't affect the video. I would recommend just muting the audio for todays video, as it isn't needed. The fish were behaving normally tonight, it was just a usual recording today. - 2021 September 10th

I had the perfect opportunity with the sound today. It doesn't matter that much, so I will move on. Todays video was pretty normal, I don't have much to say still. Maybe I should get videos of the other tank as well to mix things up. - 2021 September 11th

The suckerfish was really aggressive earlier, but I didn't get it on footage. It was going after the other fish, but they all got away in time. I really wonder how they survive this. The suckerfish normally isn't aggressive, only when it is hyper. I got an interesting video today, I finally got a good video of the fish feeding, I didn't get the entire process, as I used up nearly a gigabyte of space, and I didn't want to go on too long. - 2021 September 12th

I didn't get an interesting video today, the audio was meh (I didn't check if the background noise made it into the video, there was a TV on again, just in a different room) again, just mute the video if it is a problem. Todays video was just a usual video. - 2021 September 13th

I got the suckerfish on camera today going against 2 other fish. I am not sure if it is play or conflict. None of the fish are getting hurt from it. Todays video was a lot longer, and had a lot less background noise. Todays video was interesting and out of the norm. - 2021 September 14th

<!-- Fishtank refilled every 3 days !-->

The fishtank has been getting refilled every 3 days for a while, until as of the past week (bad grammar) the suckerfish was "playful" again today, and the fish were active most of the time. I recorded a video over 1 and a half minutes today in the white light. The audio was good, but there was some unwanted background noise. I managed to end just in the last 5 seconds before everything went calm for the night. - 2021 September 15th

I got a decent video today in the usual lighting, with better background audio. Not much happened today. - 2021 September 16th

## Proposals and consideration

### 2021 proposals

**Entries for June 2021 need to be dated at some point.**

#### June 2021 proposals

It is under consideration that we give away some goldfish, as the tank might be overpopulated. It is a new decision, and some of us are a bit hesitant, as the fish are pretty happy right now, and taking away their friends might make them very unhappy. If I am to give some away, I am going to do it free of charge, and to someone in need of some companions.
<!-- !-->

It is also now under consideration on moving the Neon Tetra fish to a separate tank, as they aren't getting big enough, and they are becoming more and more vulnerable. It has always been a concern that the other fish would vore them, and the fear is getting larger, as the goldfish are over 2.54 centimeters (1 inch) long now.

#### July 2021 proposals

Proposal: specialized fishtank room, surroundings, a room I can get videos of anywhere, also in the future, a larger tank. - July 11th 2021

Proposal: make a full length video of the fish eating. This idea has been put aside for some time, and I am now proposing it officially. - July 16th 2021

#### August 2021 proposals

Proposal: Name all the fish. - August 17th 2021

Naming progress

After some decision, the yellow sucker fish is being named "Sucky" with the nickname of "Sir Sucks a lot" (Sucky Aquarius Myrick)

The name is not meant to be an insult, he just sucks. Thats what he does, hes a sucker fish, he sucks the gravel and finds food. It is his anatomy.

I am considering naming the largest Grey Goldfish Fred, as he looks brown, and reminds me of Fred (the "MY LEG!!!" guy from SpongeBob Squarepants (TV Series)) although a name decision has not started yet.

The snail is considered to be named Grlarrious (portmanteau of 3 words: grey, larry, and curious) - August 18th 2021

> Larry was derived from SpongeBobs second snail Larry, Gary was not a fitting name for this snail, as I am reserving it for if I ever have a snail close enough to that.

<!--
Cleaning, filter replaced, refill
Considering giving away some goldfish, tank might be overpopulated
!-->

<!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->

#### 2021 September proposals

It is being considered renaming the suckerfish again, as sucky is not the best name. The fish deserves a better name. - 2021 September 11th

It is also being considered to record the other tank as well to see if there is anything interesting there. - 2021 September 11th

No other proposals yet for this month. (As of Saturday, 2021 September 11th)
