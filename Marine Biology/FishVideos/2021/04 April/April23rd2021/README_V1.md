# Video for today (April 23rd 2021)

I got a normal video today of the fish swimming around and enjoying life again. Tonights video was back at the normal dark blue lighting that is normally on for night mode, and todays vido was 30 seconds again.

I didn't copy the video to my laptop, so right now, I can't get the file size estimate.

## Availability online

Videos are not yet available on GitHub, as todays video (NaN MiB/NaN MB) significantly exceeds GitHubs upload limit (25 MiB/26.214 MB)
