# Video for today (April 22nd 2021)

I got a normal video today of the fish swimming around and enjoying life again. The light was left on all night again, despite it being on all day. The filters have reached their capacity, and are going to need to be replaced soon. Todays video was 30 seconds long.

So an update, the Blue Neon Tetrafish have not gotten any bloodworms yet, we haven't experimented with this yet, as we don't know if they will even get to them before the other fish take them. For now, they are getting large flakes of Goldfish food like the others. They seem to like it, and aren't unhealthy.
