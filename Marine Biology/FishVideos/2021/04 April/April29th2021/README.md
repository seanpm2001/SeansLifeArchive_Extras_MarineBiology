# Video for today (April 29th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 60 seconds (1 minute) long. This video was created around 8:00 pm, so I guess it documents the fish at this hour of the day. Other than that, nothing out of the ordinary happened in the recording process today, although I did record it 2-4 hours before I normally make the video.
