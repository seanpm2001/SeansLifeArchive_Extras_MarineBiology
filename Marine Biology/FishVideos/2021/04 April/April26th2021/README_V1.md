# Video for today (April 26th 2021)

I got a normal video today, but felt like I was recording with sea legs, as I was really wobbly. It didn't affect the video too badly, but it was noticeable.

I took a little preview of the new fish feeding calendar in this video, so that the fish don't get overfed or underfed. Todays video was in a dark shade of blue, and had cool effects with the fish passing through red lights. I am trying to think of a new unique idea for a daily video, I am still considering a birds eye view (aerial view) video.
