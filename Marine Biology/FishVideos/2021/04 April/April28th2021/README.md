# Video for today (April 28th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 60 seconds, although I had to record immediately after turning the light on, and turn it off immediately tonight due to the bright light and sleeping problems. Today, the snail showed itself in full view in the video, it rarely shows itself.
