# Video for today (April 30th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 30 seconds long. This video was created around 10:14 pm, so I guess it documents the fish at this hour of the day, which was a common time. Not much unique happened, it is just normal 4K stock fishtank footage. I would like to note how unique the cleaner fish look in contrast to the other fish (since they are the type of fish that you don't have to be worried about when they are sitting at the bottom, because that would mean they are sick/dying) it makes it look like a dragon flying around. This fish was active tonight.
