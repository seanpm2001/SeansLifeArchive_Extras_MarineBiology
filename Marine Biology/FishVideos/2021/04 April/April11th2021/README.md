# Video for today:

I recorded a short video tonight. Tonights video was 1 minute and 5 seconds long. A very minor environmental change was made, and I recorded with a unique blue light.

<!-- The below description was made on April 11th 2021. Notes were started 1 day early. A video has not yet been made for this day. !-->

I don't know how noticeable this is, but a plant died in the fishtank and floated to the top, so it had to be removed. I never even noticed the plant before. Update: it hass not been removed yet. It isn't causing much harm, and the fish were interested in it earlier.
