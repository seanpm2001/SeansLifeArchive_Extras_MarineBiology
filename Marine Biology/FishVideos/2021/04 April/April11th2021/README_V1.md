# Video for today:

I recorded a short video tonight. <further description goes here>

<!-- The below description was made on April 10th 2021. Notes were started 1 day early. A video has not yet been made for this day. !-->

I don't know how noticeable this is, but a plant died in the fishtank and floated to the top, so it had to be removed. I never even noticed the plant before.
