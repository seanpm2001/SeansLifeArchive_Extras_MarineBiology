# Video for today (May 27th 2021)

I got a normal video today, after midnight. Todays video was 45 seconds long. Todays video was done in the blue light today. I did something unique, and had an interesting opening, where I started with my camera pointed down, and gradually moved it up, then closed in on the fishtank, a cinematic feature. Other than that, I just got normal stock footage. <!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
