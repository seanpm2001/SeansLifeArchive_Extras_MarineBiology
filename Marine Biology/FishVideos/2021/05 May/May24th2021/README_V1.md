# Video for today (May 24th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 30 seconds long. Todays video was also done in the blue light today. Today, I just got normal stock footage. I noted that the fish look strange in a blue shade. <!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
