# Video for today (May 15th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 31 seconds long. Todays video was done in the blue light today again. Today, I just got normal stock footage. The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. I don't have an original description for today, everything was normal. I guess I have something to add: I zoomed in on the fish to point out how they all start crowding together to beg when you come near them. Pretty normal animal stuff.
