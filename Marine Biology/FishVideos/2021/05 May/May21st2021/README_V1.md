# Video for today (May 21st 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 48 seconds long. Todays video was done in the white light today. Today, I just got normal stock footage. The suckerfish was not active tonight, and the video is best viewed without audio today, as I had hiccups during the video. <!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
