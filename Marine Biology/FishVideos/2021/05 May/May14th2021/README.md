# Video for today (May 14th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 30 seconds long. Todays video was done in the blue light today again. Today, I just got normal stock footage. The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them.
