# Video for today (May 5th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 41 seconds long again. There wasn't much unique about todays video, just more 4K Fish stock footage, but in the dark blue light again. The fish were mostly in the corner, and I did even more zooming in and out, just to be unique.
