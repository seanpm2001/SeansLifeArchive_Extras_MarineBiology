# Video for today (May 16th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 45 seconds long. Todays video was done in the full light today. Today, I just got normal stock footage. I zoomed in on several fish doing fish things. The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them.
