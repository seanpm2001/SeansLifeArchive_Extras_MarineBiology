# Video for today (May 28th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 60 seconds (1 minute) long. Todays video was also done in the blue light today. Today, I just got normal stock footage.

Earlier today, me and my family did maintenance on the fishtank, doing some safe cleaning, replacing the filter, and doing a refill. I learned that the filters use Charcoal, which automatically absorbs the toxins out of the water. I initially didn't know charcoal was safe to put in the fishtank, I thought it would be like putting coal into the tank. I am not much of a chemist, so don't be surprised that this is new to me.

It is under consideration that we give away some goldfish, as the tank might be overpopulated. It is a new decision, and some of us are a bit hesitant, as the fish are pretty happy right now, and taking away their friends might make them very unhappy. If I am to give some away, I am going to do it free of charge, and to someone in need of some companions.

<!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
