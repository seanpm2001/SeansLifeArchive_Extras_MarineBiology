# Video for today (May 12th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 30 seconds long. Todays video was done in full brightness, as not everyone was in bed yet. I just got normal fishtank stock footage today. The fish were not fed today, as we all forgot. I made sure to give them extra the next day. Goldfish can go a while without food, although it isn't preferable.
