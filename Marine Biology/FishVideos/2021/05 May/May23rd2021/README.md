# Video for today (May 23rd 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 60 seconds (1 minute) long. Todays video was also done in the blue light today. Today, I just got normal stock footage. <!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
