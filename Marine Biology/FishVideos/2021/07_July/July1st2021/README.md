# Video for today (July 1st 2021)

I got a longer video today, todays video was 30 seconds long today. Todays video was done in the blue light. We normally have the blue light on, as it doesn't bug the other residents in the house this way. It wasn't an issue tonight, so it was disabled. <!-- Todays video was done in the normal white light for once in some time. !--> Today, I just got normal stock footage.

It is under consideration that we give away some goldfish, as the tank might be overpopulated. It is a new decision, and some of us are a bit hesitant, as the fish are pretty happy right now, and taking away their friends might make them very unhappy. If I am to give some away, I am going to do it free of charge, and to someone in need of some companions.

It is also now under consideration on moving the Neon Tetra fish to a separate tank, as they aren't getting big enough, and they are becoming more and more vulnerable. It has always been a concern that the other fish would vore them, and the fear is getting larger, as the goldfish are over 2.54 centimeters (1 inch) long now.

There was a new concern x days ago regarding the cleaner fish, it was unknown what was growing on its face (I noticed a symmetrical pattern of a 3x3 grid of pink scabs, along with a ton of white scabs on the fish's head) it was researched, it is likely not a [Lymphocystivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocystivirus) but more likely an aspect of catfish aging, which is reasonable, as the markings were symmetrical, and this fish is at least 8 years old.

I have been observing a fish recently, I have finally identified it this evening (Tuesday, June 22nd 2021) which is that one of the bright orange goldfish has a possible bacterial infection in the operculum (gill cover, or the part that is between the head and the rest of the body) before this, I have noted for a few weeks that its eye has been pretty bad. I have now determined that the fish really isn't doing too well, and I feel bad for it (a little bit sad as well) I am looking for a solution, I have researched (but please, don't try this yourself until you do proper research as well, as I know you don't want to harm your fish) but adding 3% salinity to the water of the diseased fish (but probably not the entire fishtank) has been noted to cure most freshwater fish bacterial infections. Again, please do not take my word for this, do your own research first and back it up, as I haven't tried this yet, and I don't know if [TheSprucePets.com]https://www.thespruecepets.com) is a safe source.

I haven't tried anything with the fish yet, it isn't getting worse, but I currently am not sure what to do.

The fish isn't getting worse, the problem has reached a stalemate.

I have failed to mention this for a long time, but I have not been able to publish any of my marine biology videos due to their excessive size (I haven't had a single video under 100 megabytes yet, and they range from 160 to 750 megabytes in size) so most of the things I am talking about can't be backed up, as you can't even see the video, so you likely don't know what I am talking about. I have been working on getting these videos to be made public (YouTube isn't an option) I have considered Vimeo, but it would cost too much to host, and I have been working on getting the videos self-hosted, but it has been a long process.

<!-- Unfortunately, in the other fishtank today, a fish died. The cause of death is unknown and an autopsy was not done. !-->

I have been observing one of the black speckled fish and have noted that it struggles to rise over an inch above the gravel before falling back down. The fish is still eating, and looks healthy other than that, I can only watch. It is eating a lot better now, but is hard to find around the tank when needed.

I have now noted that the fish has swam up for oxygen multiple times, and is doing a lot better.

The fish is no longer of concern. - June 30th 2021

<!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
