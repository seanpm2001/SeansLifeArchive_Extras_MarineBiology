## About

I got a very long video today, my longest one to date. It was 2 minutes (120 seconds) of calming 4K fishtank footage. <!-- Todays video was a bit blurry, as I didn't turn off another light before recording, as I didn't think it would affect it. Todays video was done in the blue light again, it has gotten pretty dark again recently, returning to a dark blue color. We normally have the blue light on, as it doesn't bug the other residents in the house this way. It was enabled. !--> Todays video was done in the white light yet again today. <!-- Todays video was done in the normal white light for once in some time. !--> Today, I just got normal stock footage. I fixed the dust issue for today. <!-- The suckerfish has been incredibly actively lately, almost like it knows it is being filmed and is photogenic. I plan on doing all the videos in the whitelight from now on, unless I want to do a dark light video on a special occasion, or if I forget, as I can turn the light on any time now. !-->

## Daily updates

### 2021 status updates

**Entries for June 2021 need to be dated at some point.**

#### June 2021 status updates

There was a new concern x days ago regarding the cleaner fish, it was unknown what was growing on its face (I noticed a symmetrical pattern of a 3x3 grid of pink scabs, along with a ton of white scabs on the fish's head) it was researched, it is likely not a [Lymphocystivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocystivirus) but more likely an aspect of catfish aging, which is reasonable, as the markings were symmetrical, and this fish is at least 8 years old.

I have been observing a fish recently, I have finally identified it this evening (Tuesday, June 22nd 2021) which is that one of the bright orange goldfish has a possible bacterial infection in the operculum (gill cover, or the part that is between the head and the rest of the body) before this, I have noted for a few weeks that its eye has been pretty bad. I have now determined that the fish really isn't doing too well, and I feel bad for it (a little bit sad as well) I am looking for a solution, I have researched (but please, don't try this yourself until you do proper research as well, as I know you don't want to harm your fish) but adding 3% salinity to the water of the diseased fish (but probably not the entire fishtank) has been noted to cure most freshwater fish bacterial infections. Again, please do not take my word for this, do your own research first and back it up, as I haven't tried this yet, and I don't know if [TheSprucePets.com]https://www.thespruecepets.com) is a safe source.

I haven't tried anything with the fish yet, it isn't getting worse, but I currently am not sure what to do.

The fish isn't getting worse, the problem has reached a stalemate.

I have failed to mention this for a long time, but I have not been able to publish any of my marine biology videos due to their excessive size (I haven't had a single video under 100 megabytes yet, and they range from 160 to 750 megabytes in size) so most of the things I am talking about can't be backed up, as you can't even see the video, so you likely don't know what I am talking about. I have been working on getting these videos to be made public (YouTube isn't an option) I have considered Vimeo, but it would cost too much to host, and I have been working on getting the videos self-hosted, but it has been a long process.

<!-- Unfortunately, in the other fishtank today, a fish died. The cause of death is unknown and an autopsy was not done. !-->

I have been observing one of the black speckled fish and have noted that it struggles to rise over an inch above the gravel before falling back down. The fish is still eating, and looks healthy other than that, I can only watch. It is eating a lot better now, but is hard to find around the tank when needed.

I have now noted that the fish has swam up for oxygen multiple times, and is doing a lot better.

The fish is no longer of concern. - June 30th 2021

#### July 2021 status updates

The fish is doing fine still and has not worsened. - July 3rd 2021

All the fish are still doing fine, the silver goldfish are growing the fastest. - July 4th 2021

Status update: the fish are still doing fine. - July 5th 2021

Status update: the fish may be doing fine, I don't know if there was 2 of the same type (of concern) to begin with, there has been only 1 for a few days. - July 6th 2021

Update: the suckerfish is extremely fast and may be a threat to other fish due to increased aggression. So far, no known deaths. - July 7th 2021

The suckerfish was extremely active tonight, and was spazzing around at the bottom of the tank for a bit. - July 8th 2021

I am under suspicion that one of the fish was killed and somehow me and some others forgot that it existed. The remains seem to be completely destroyed, so unfortunately if it did exist, no funeral can be held. - July 9th 2021

The suckerfish may be photogenic. - July 10th 2021

The light emulates day and night for the fish. I wonder what their days are like when it is so inconsistent. - July 11th 2021

First 8K video today, 4K videos return tomorrow. - July 12th 2021

Returned to 4K videos today, but with a higher aspect ratio. - July 13th 2021

Purple lighting today. - July 14th 2021

I forgot my rule and filmed in the blue light today, I guess I just didn't care enough. They need a nighttime anyways. - July 15th 2021

Blue light again today, and a very long video. Some interaction was done. - July 16th 2021

I have recently gotten burnt out mentally on getting these videos, and want to improve the tank to feel better about getting more footage, or doing something to make the videos a lot better. - July 17th 2021

My burnout has gone away slightly, I need to focus on ways of making better videos sometime soon. The fish are doing fine today. - July 18th 2021

BONUS: This README file was heavily improved today and is now better sorted and categorized. It contains better info, and is now part of a routine of 3 updates every 3 days. - July 18th 2021

I got a longer video today to make up for the lack of activity. Todays video length makes up for the movement. I wasn't burnt out today. The fish were again doing fine today. - July 19th 2021

I don't know what happened, but todays video was a bit foggy/dusty, I do not know what happened to cause it to do this, but I will attempt to fix this by tomorrow. - July 20th 2021

I wasn't able to fix the dust issue, but it was fine. The fish are also doing fine. - July 21st 2021

I fixed the dust issue, and got my longest video to date, being 120 seconds (or 2 minutes) long and taking up over a gigabyte in size. The fish were calm during the video, and I made it longer, so that it could calm future viewers. - July 22nd 2021

## Proposals and consideration

### 2021 proposals

**Entries for June 2021 need to be dated at some point.**

#### June 2021 proposals

It is under consideration that we give away some goldfish, as the tank might be overpopulated. It is a new decision, and some of us are a bit hesitant, as the fish are pretty happy right now, and taking away their friends might make them very unhappy. If I am to give some away, I am going to do it free of charge, and to someone in need of some companions.
<!-- !-->

It is also now under consideration on moving the Neon Tetra fish to a separate tank, as they aren't getting big enough, and they are becoming more and more vulnerable. It has always been a concern that the other fish would vore them, and the fear is getting larger, as the goldfish are over 2.54 centimeters (1 inch) long now.

#### July 2021 proposals

Proposal: specialized fishtank room, surroundings, a room I can get videos of anywhere, also in the future, a larger tank. - July 11th 2021

Proposal: make a full length video of the fish eating. This idea has been put aside for some time, and I am now proposing it officially. - July 16th 2021

<!--
Cleaning, filter replaced, refill
Considering giving away some goldfish, tank might be overpopulated
!-->

<!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
