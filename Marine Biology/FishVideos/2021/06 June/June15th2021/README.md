# Video for today (June 15th 2021)

I got a normal video today, todays video was 60 seconds long. Todays video was also done in the blue light again today. <!-- Todays video was done in the normal white light for once in some time. !--> Today, I just got normal stock footage.

It is under consideration that we give away some goldfish, as the tank might be overpopulated. It is a new decision, and some of us are a bit hesitant, as the fish are pretty happy right now, and taking away their friends might make them very unhappy. If I am to give some away, I am going to do it free of charge, and to someone in need of some companions.

It is also now under consideration on moving the Neon Tetra fish to a separate tank, as they aren't getting big enough, and they are becoming more and more vulnerable. It has always been a concern that the other fish would vore them, and the fear is getting larger, as the goldfish are over 2.54 centimeters (1 inch) long now.

There was a new concern x days ago regarding the cleaner fish, it was unknown what was growing on its face (I noticed a symmetrical pattern of a 3x3 grid of pink scabs, along with a ton of white scabs on the fish's head) it was researched, it is likely not a [Lymphocystivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocystivirus) but more likely an aspect of catfish aging, which is reasonable, as the markings were symmetrical, and this fish is at least 8 years old.

<!-- The fish are still doing well, and I am considering doing something about the other family tank, as it has gone pretty unnoticed by everyone other than the family member who has them. People in the family have been feeding the fish but not logging it, I am taking their word, but I hope to improve the log system. !-->
