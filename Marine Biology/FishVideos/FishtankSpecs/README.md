### Filter

**Filter:** [Link unavailable]()

_We finally got a heavy duty filter. This filter is for 60 gallon tanks, but it works well in a 29 gallon tank._

### Gravel

**Gravel:** [Link unavailable]()

_This fishtank still uses old colorful blue gravel. The Koi I had from 2010 to 2021 really liked to shoot the rocks around with its mouth to get our attention, and I am really going to continue to miss that._

### Lid

**Lid:** [Link unavailable]()

_We recently got a new, transparent plastic fishtank lid that opens up. We bought it, so that the LED lights wouldn't directly get splashed on constantly._

#### Lighting

**Lid lights:** [Link unavailable]()

_Our new fishtank lights are extremely beautiful to all of us. The lights have a few mode settings, and several combinations of blue and white light settings._

### Decorations

**Decorations:** [Link1 unavailable]() [Link2 unavailable]() [Link3 unavailable]() [Link4 unavailable]()

_It might be harder for me to get info on current fishtank decorations, due to them possibly being uncommon, and all the current decorations being 4-9 years old._

### Plants

**Plants:** [Link1 unavailable]() [Link2 unavailable]() [Link3 unavailable]()

_This fishtank contains only decoration plants. The other fishtank features live plants._

### Feeding

**Fishfood:** [TetraFin Goldfish flakes (Wal*Mart link)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TetraFin-Goldfish-Flakes-7-06-Ounces-Balanced-Diet-Fish-Food/10312985) [Tetra bloodworms (Wal*Mart link)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tetra-Bloodworms-24-OZ/470814729)

_The fish are fed multiple times per day (2-4 times) the filter is turned off before feeding to prevent the tank from getting dirty. 5-15 minutes later, the fishtank filter is turned back on._

_All the fish are capable of eating the flake food, but the neon Tetra fish require the bloodworm food._
