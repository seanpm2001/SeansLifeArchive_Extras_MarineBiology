## Discovery of Single celled organisms

Humanity really has put a lot of thought into going into outer space, but we have rarely paid attention to exploring the ocean. There is still over 70% of our planet we haven't discovered yet, it is weird how we can go into space and see galaxies so far from us, but we can't go into our own oceans on our own planet.

I was thinking this morning (Wednesday, July 7th 2021) about what is really at the bottom of the ocean. I was thinking that what if we found the original single celled organisms from before animals walked on land? What if they are all still down there? If they are, can they unlock the secrets of life? It would be amazing if these creatures from over a billion years ago were still down there. What could they teach us? We haven't explored the oceans too much yet, so we don't entirely know. Lets start exploring!
